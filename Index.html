        <h3>My Work Life</h3>

        <p>Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at UCSD, I am a data enthusiast deeply engaged in expanding my expertise, particularly in Customer, Fraud, and Product Analytics. This academic endeavor is a continuation of my commitment to excel in the analytics and data science domains. With 4 years of experience in Quick Commerce, my background is a testament to my ability to solve complex challenges in fraud prevention and customer analytics. I also hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from SRMIST, India.</p>

        <p>In my professional journey at Dunzo Digital Pvt. Ltd., I spearheaded a team to develop an automated, real-time fraud prevention system, leading to significant operational efficiencies. My skill set includes SQL (Athena and BQ), Tableau, Excel, Python, Vertex AI (GCP), and Google Data Studio, with proficiency in GitHub and Atlassian (Confluence and JIRA board).</p>

        <p>Before joining Dunzo, I honed my skills in digital marketing analytics, managing SEO for clients across diverse sectors, thereby broadening my understanding of market dynamics and consumer behavior.</p>

        <p>I am proud of my contribution to academic research with the publication: "Implementation of Neural Network on Network Intrusion Detection System." In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I serve as the General Secretary of the Creative Foundation, an Indian NGO.</p>
            
        <p>As I approach the completion of my master's program in December 2024, I am actively seeking opportunities in the analytics and data science fields, where I can apply my analytical acumen and Python proficiency to drive meaningful insights and business growth.</p>
